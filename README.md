*IN THIS WEATHER APP PROJECT, WE USED THREE MAIN TECHNOLOGIES: HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. HTML IS USED TO BUILD THE STRUCTURE OF THE WEBPAGE, INCLUDING ELEMENTS LIKE THE INPUT BOX, BUTTON, AND AREA TO DISPLAY THE WEATHER RESULT. CSS IS USED TO STYLE THE PAGE, MAKING IT LOOK VISUALLY APPEALING WITH FEATURES LIKE A GRADIENT BACKGROUND, CENTERED LAYOUT USING FLEXBOX, RESPONSIVE DESIGN FOR MOBILE SCREENS, AND STYLED BUTTONS AND INPUT FIELDS. JAVASCRIPT ADDS INTERACTIVITY TO THE PAGE â€” WHEN A USER TYPES A CITY NAME AND CLICKS THE "GET WEATHER" BUTTON, THE SCRIPT USES THE FETCH API TO SEND A REQUEST TO THE OPENWEATHERMAP API, WHICH RETURNS REAL-TIME WEATHER DATA. THE APP THEN DISPLAYS THE TEMPERATURE, WEATHER CONDITION, AND HUMIDITY USING DOM MANIPULATION, MEANING IT UPDATES THE CONTENT OF THE PAGE WITHOUT RELOADING IT. THE SCRIPT ALSO INCLUDES ERROR HANDLING TO ALERT THE USER IF THE CITY NAME IS MISSING OR INVALID. OVERALL, THIS PROJECT COMBINES FRONTEND DESIGN, API INTEGRATION, AND USER INTERACTION TO CREATE A SIMPLE, FUNCTIONAL WEATHER APPLICATION.
THE HTML FILE SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE PROJECT. IT DEFINES THE PAGE TITLE, LINKS THE EXTERNAL CSS AND JAVASCRIPT FILES, AND CONTAINS THE MAIN CONTENT CONTAINER. INSIDE THE BODY SECTION, AN INPUT FIELD ALLOWS USERS TO ENTER A CITY NAME. A BUTTON TRIGGERS THE JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION, AND A DESIGNATED DIV (#WEATHERRESULT) IS USED TO DISPLAY THE WEATHER DATA. THE PAGE IS DESIGNED TO BE CLEAN AND USER-FRIENDLY.
THE CSS FILE IMPROVES THE VISUAL APPEARANCE OF THE WEBPAGE. BY USING A LINEAR GRADIENT BACKGROUND, IT CREATES A PLEASING COLOR TRANSITION. FLEXBOX IS USED TO CENTER THE CONTENT BOTH HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY, CREATING A BALANCED LAYOUT. ADDITIONALLY, BUTTON HOVER EFFECTS, INPUT FOCUS STYLES, AND MEDIA QUERIES MAKE THE INTERFACE INTERACTIVE AND RESPONSIVE ACROSS DIFFERENT SCREEN SIZES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS.
THE JAVASCRIPT FILE CONTAINS THE LOGIC THAT POWERS THE APPLICATION. IT STARTS BY DEFINING AN API KEY, WHICH IS REQUIRED TO AUTHENTICATE REQUESTS TO OPENWEATHERMAP. WHEN THE USER CLICKS THE BUTTON, THE FUNCTION GETWEATHER() IS CALLED. THIS FUNCTION FIRST CHECKS IF THE INPUT FIELD IS EMPTY. IF NOT, IT BUILDS A URL FOR THE WEATHER API, INCLUDING THE CITY NAME, API KEY, AND UNIT FORMAT (CELSIUS). THEN IT USES THE FETCH FUNCTION TO MAKE AN ASYNCHRONOUS HTTP GET REQUEST TO THE API. THE RESPONSE IS PARSED AS JSON, AND IF THE RESPONSE CODE IS SUCCESSFUL (200), THE WEATHER DATA IS FORMATTED USING TEMPLATE LITERALS AND INSERTED INTO THE HTML. IF THE CITY IS INVALID OR NOT FOUND, A USER-FRIENDLY ERROR MESSAGE IS SHOWN. ERROR HANDLING IS ALSO INCLUDED TO CATCH NETWORK FAILURES OR API ISSUES.
THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES A BASIC YET COMPLETE FRONTEND WEB APPLICATION. IT COVERS KEY SKILLS SUCH AS PAGE STRUCTURING WITH HTML, VISUAL ENHANCEMENT WITH CSS, AND DATA HANDLING WITH JAVASCRIPT. IT ALSO INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF USING THIRD-PARTY APIS TO ACCESS REAL-TIME DATA, WHICH IS COMMON IN MODERN WEB DEVELOPMENT.
